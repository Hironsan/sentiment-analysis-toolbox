# practical sentiment analysis
In this project, you can quickly perform sentiment analysis on some datasets such as Tweets, movie review and so on since all of the codes are on Jupyter Notebooks.
Also, there are various methods such as SVM, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Convolutional Neural Network and so on.

So far, the datasets and methods are as follows:
* [IMDb SVM](https://github.com/Hironsan/practical-sentiment-analysis/blob/master/notebooks/imdb_svm.ipynb)
* [umich_si650 RandomForest](https://github.com/Hironsan/practical-sentiment-analysis/blob/master/notebooks/umich_si650.ipynb)

# Installation

To install required libraries, simply:
